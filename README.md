Singapore Resale Flat refers to public housing flats sold on the secondary market by owners after their initial purchase from the Housing & Development Board (HDB). These flats are typically 4 to 99 years old and are resold at market prices, influenced by factors such as location, flat type, remaining lease, and condition. The resale flat market provides an affordable housing option for Singaporeans who wish to buy existing flats rather than new ones directly from HDB.

What I Did

•	Collected Singapore HDB resale flat data from dataset.

•	Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handled missing values, converted dates, created features).

•	Performed exploratory data analysis to understand pricing trends and key factors.

•	Selected important features like flat type, town, floor area, storey range, and remaining lease.

How I Predicted Resale Flat Prices

•	Split data into training and testing sets.

•	Trained machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, DecisionTree Regression.

•	Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score.

•	Chose Random Forest as the best model for prediction accuracy.

•	Built a Streamlit app to input flat details and output predicted resale prices in real time.
